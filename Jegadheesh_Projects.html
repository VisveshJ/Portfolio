              <h5>September 2019</h5>
              <!---Content for the Page--->
                <p>My partner and I decided to develop a multiplayer racing game using Scratch. This project took around two to three weeks, in when we discussed various features to the game, various characters, various cars, and more racing attributes. In this project, I was in charge of keeping track of documentation and helping to add side features to the main game. My partner and I were able to work effectively and efficiently to create a full-fledged, functional racing game that was popular in the class and with others as well. Overall, this project was a very fun and unique project to create.</p>

            <h5>October 2019</h5>
            <!---Content--->
                <p>My partner and I were assigned to create a game using the MIT App Inventor. With this service, we decided to create a multiplayer mini golf game. In this game, we would be able to pit two players against each other and have them play till whoever hits the ball in the hole first and efficiently. In this project, I was assigned to help build some of the features in the game and record our documentation. My partner and I collaborated efficiently and smoothly, as we were also able to add various features to the game, such as ball speed, obstacles, and scoreboards. Overall, this project was very successful and we were able to recieve positive comments on our product.</p>

            <h2>Brilliant Minds Academy's Website</h2>
              <h5>Summer 2018</h5>
              <!---Content--->
                <p>Over the summer of my sophomore year, I took up a job at the Brilliant Minds Academy in Dublin to help create and develop an e-learning website. I worked at Brilliant Minds for 2 hrs a day every week, and worked for over 10 weeks in the summer. In this job, I helped to create various worksheets and assignments for various grade levels, from kindergarten to 8th grade, in topics such as math, science, and English. In addition, I helped to create the user interface by creating a design and getting it approved by the director of the Academy.The website was able to launch in September 2018, and has been approved of by its users.</p>

            <h2>Shooting Stars Stem-A-Thon</h2>
              <h5>April 2019</h5>
                <p>As part of my volunteer experience at Shooting Stars Foundation, I was assigned to organize an event that would raise enough money to sponsor education for students in third world countries. In a month, I was able to plan a full on Stem-A-Thon with my colleagues in San Jose, and we were able to run a smooth and effective event. In this event, I also created various computer simulations for younger kids to solve in the competition. The simulations ranged from simple puzzles to thought-provoking riddles, and overall,the simulations and the overall event received positive comments and feedback.</p>
