          <p>Hi, my name is Visvesh Jegadheesh. I am currently a senior attending Dublin High School. I have lived in Dublin for over 6 years now, and have lived in Fremont for 11 years before that. I am excited to share information about me with you! </p>

          <p>Throughout my 4 years of high school, some of my coursework includes AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Biology, AP Computer Science Principles, Spanish 4 Honors, and Honors Chemistry. I intend to pursue a career in the STEM field, with more detail in the paragraph below.</p>

          <p>In the future, I want to be a bioinformatics scientist. I am interested in the field of biology and informatics, and I want to further my interest in the field by studying this in the future. Bioinformatics interests me as I am able to study biology and combine it with computer science, and make various models of various biological structures. Furthermore, in a world where automation and robotics become more important, being able to make models of complex biological systems and applying them to automation will help them become more important and significant.</p>

          <p>For my career, I feel I will be successful due to my responsible and authoritative mindset. For example, in this career field, it is necessary for workers to be proactive and self-motivated, as they need to be able to create various computer simulations and diagrams. I feel that with my responsible and authoritative ideas, I will be able to lead these teams successfully and effectively. In addition, I consider myself to be an effective team leader, as I have led the Dublin High School Cricket Team to various runner-up trophies, and have been able to manage many various conflicts in it. Overall, I feel that my leadership and responsibility skills will help me succeed.</p>

          <p>One of my major accomplishments during high school was receiving the National Merit Commended Scholar Award. This award was rewarded to a very select group of people (50,000 out of 1.5 million) and I was able to achieve a score on the PSAT that was necessary for me to recieve the honor. This honor allowed me to gain official recognition from the Dublin School District. I have also recieved the AP Scholar with Distinction Award, as well as a certification in HTML and CSS by Microsoft Technology Associate. </p>

          <p>If you have any more questions about me or my interests, you can contact me through email! Details listed on the contact me page.</p>
